Procedure:
To solve this you have to first figure out the subnet mask from the given CIDR (/29)

Note: Th CIDR indicates the total number of active bits (1's) which also indicates the network portion of the IP address while the 0's indicate the host portion of the network.

Converting it to binary then gives:

Network Portion: 1's

Host Portion: 0's

Netmask Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000

Then inorder to convert the subnet mask address from binary to decimal apply the following formular:

Note: In the binary system there are only 1s and 0s. Depending on their position in the octet, they get different values. Each position is a power of 2. To get the decimal number you have to sum up those numbers.

First Octet	Second Octet	Third Octet	Fourth Octet	Fifth Octet	Sixth Octet	Seventh Octet	Eight Octet
2^7	2^6	2^5	2^4	2^3	2^2	2^1	2^0
128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
Total no. of octets in binary: 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1

                         = 255
First Octet:
First Octet	Second Octet	Third Octet	Fourth Octet	Fifth Octet	Sixth Octet	Seventh Octet	Eight Octet
128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1
Total: 255

Second Octet:
First Octet	Second Octet	Third Octet	Fourth Octet	Fifth Octet	Sixth Octet	Seventh Octet	Eight Octet
128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1
Total: 255

Third Octet:
First Octet	Second Octet	Third Octet	Fourth Octet	Fifth Octet	Sixth Octet	Seventh Octet	Eight Octet
128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1
Total: 255

Fourth Octet:
First Octet	Second Octet	Third Octet	Fourth Octet	Fifth Octet	Sixth Octet	Seventh Octet	Eight Octet
128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0
Total: 248

Octet Sum = 255.255.255.248

Therefore: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000 in binary = 255.255.255.248

Next is to find the wild card:
Wild card = subtract the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255

      = 255.255.255.255 - 255.255.255.248
      
      = 255 - 248
      
      = 7
... Wild card = 0.0.0.7

Next is to find the network ID:
Where

Subnet Mask = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000

Given IP = 11000001.00010000.00010100.00100011

To find the network ID, simply do binary and operation between the given IP address and the subnet mask:

First Octet:
Binary and operation between (255 & 193) or (11111111 & 11000001)

N/A	First Octet	Second Octet	Third Octet	Fourth Octet	Fifth Octet	Sixth Octet	Seventh Octet	Eight Octet
Subnet Mask	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1
Given IP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
Result	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
Total Sum = 193

Second Octet:
Binary and operation between (255 & 16) or (11111111 & 00010000)

N/A	First Octet	Second Octet	Third Octet	Fourth Octet	Fifth Octet	Sixth Octet	Seventh Octet	Eight Octet
Subnet Mask	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1
Given IP	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Result	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Total Sum = 16

Third Octet:
Binary and operation between (255 & 20) or (11111111 & 00010100)

N/A	First Octet	Second Octet	Third Octet	Fourth Octet	Fifth Octet	Sixth Octet	Seventh Octet	Eight Octet
Subnet Mask	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1
Given IP	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
Result	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
Total Sum = 20

Fourth Octet:
Binary and operation between (248 & 35) or (11111000 & 00100011)

N/A	First Octet	Second Octet	Third Octet	Fourth Octet	Fifth Octet	Sixth Octet	Seventh Octet	Eight Octet
Subnet Mask	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0
Given IP	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1
Result	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Total Sum = 32

... network IP address = 193.16.20.32

Next is to find the number of hosts:
Number of Hosts = 2^n - 2

Where n = number of host bits minus two

        = number of host bits - 2
This is because the first and last IP addresses are always reserved for the network and broadcast ID's respectively

Note In this case we have to count the number of host's bits (0's) in the subnet mask binary starting from the right, which will give a total of 3

Number of hosts = 2^3 - 2

            = 8 - 2
            
            = 6
From the details above we can then calculate the range of IP addresses and the broadcast:

Note The first & last IP adress will be reserved for the network and broadcast so:

Given IP: 193.16.20.35/29

Network IP: 193.16.20.32

Number of Hosts: 6

Range of IP Addresses: 193.16.20.33 - 193.16.20.38

min range of IP's = 193.16.20.33
max range of IP's = 193.16.20.38
Broadcast IP: 193.16.20.39
